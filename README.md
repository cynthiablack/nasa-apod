# NASA Picture of the Day Search
A simple demo site created to practice API calls.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

The site provides an HTML wrapper and user interface for a simple fetch function that calls NASA's picture of the day API based on a user-selected date.

## Planned Enhancements

- add keyword search function
- possibly roll functionality into NASA Rover site

## Lessons Learned:

Because NASA's picture of the day database includes both images and videos, media_type handling was necessary to consistently return results for each date.
